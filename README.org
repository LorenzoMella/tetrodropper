** Building instructions

   - Make.

   - Compiles under Linux with =glibc= and =ncurses=.

** Missing features

   - Catching the window-resize signal. For now, use an =80x25= terminal window at a minimum.
   - Instantaneous drop.
   - Integrating height-related drops into the point system.
   - I/O features to save the rankings.
